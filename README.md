# BiMC

This is the official implementation of paper **Enhancing Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning via Training-Free Bi-Level Modality Calibration (CVPR 2025)**.

## Abstract

Few-shot Class-Incremental Learning (FSCIL) challenges models to adapt to new classes with limited samples, presenting greater difficulties than traditional class-incremental learning. While existing approaches rely heavily on visual models and require additional training during base or incremental phases, we propose a training-free framework that leverages pre-trained visual-language models like CLIP. At the core of our approach is a novel Bi-level Modality Calibration (BiMC) strategy. Our framework initially performs intra-modal calibration, combining LLM-generated fine-grained category descriptions with visual prototypes from the base session to achieve precise classifier estimation. This is further complemented by inter-modal calibration that fuses pre-trained linguistic knowledge with task-specific visual priors to mitigate modality-specific biases. To enhance prediction robustness, we introduce additional metrics and strategies that maximize the utilization of limited data. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing methods.

## Installation

### Dataset

Please follow [CEC](https://github.com/icoz69/CEC-CVPR2021) to download *mini*-ImageNet, CUB-200 and CIFAR-100.

### Requirement

- `torch==1.13.1`
- `torchvision==0.14.1`
- `yacs==0.1.8` 
- `tqdm==4.66.1`
- `ftfy==6.1.1`
- `regex==2023.10.3`
- `scikit-learn==1.3.2`

## Experiments

First, remember to modify the data path `ROOT` in the `dataset` configuration file.

~~~BASH
# CIFAR BIMC
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/cifar100.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc.yaml

# CIFAR BIMC_Ensemble
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/cifar100.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc_ensemble.yaml

# MiniImagenet BIMC
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/miniimagenet.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc.yaml

# MiniImagenet BIMC_Ensemble
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/miniimagenet.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc_ensemble.yaml

# CUB200 BIMC
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/cub200.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc.yaml

# CUB200 BIMC_Ensemble
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/cub200.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc_ensemble.yaml

## Frequency contribution diagnostic

Run the training-free frequency counterfactual diagnostic with:

~~~BASH
python main.py --data_cfg ./configs/datasets/cifar100.yaml --train_cfg ./configs/trainers/bimc_freq_analysis.yaml
~~~

The diagnostic samples five deterministic, center-cropped training images per
class, removes low-, mid-, and high-frequency radial Fourier bands in turn, and
measures the resulting drop in CLIP's correct-class semantic margin. It does not
change or train the BiMC classifier. Per-session and all-class JSON/CSV reports
are written under `outputs/frequency_analysis/<dataset>_seed<seed>/`.

In `all_classes_frequency_contribution.json`, inspect
`class_effect_eta_squared`, the dominant-band distribution, and
`mean_pairwise_frequency_weight_l1`. Larger values indicate that the measured
frequency contribution varies more strongly between classes. The default
`COMPETITOR_SCOPE: all` uses all dataset class names so results are comparable
between sessions; this is an offline analysis setting, not a deployable FSCIL
protocol. Set it to `accumulated` for a strict session-time diagnostic.
